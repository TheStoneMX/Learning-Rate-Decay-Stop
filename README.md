# Learning Rate Decay Stop

Adaptive Learning Rate - these algorithms are just the learning rate base on what the learning algorithm knows about the problem and the data it`s seen so far.


This means not only we need to decrease the learning rate whe we need it, but also increase it when appears to low.

The code was developed in Pytorh

The EarlyStopping class in adaptivelearning.py is inspired by the ignite EarlyStopping class.
